    "\n",
    "Neural coding describes how neurons represent information about the world. Coding can be studied by asking whether external or internal events lead to changes in neural activity (<b>encoding</b>), or by asking whether different types of information can be read out from neural activity (<b>decoding</b>). In this workshop we will address the question of neural encoding, with a focus on single cell encoding models. \n",
    "\n",
    "Encoding of <b>sensory</b> information has been studied for decades by presenting animals with stimuli and observing how the activity of individual neurons changes. To study encoding of <b>motor</b> variables, researchers train animals to perform a behavior (or observe naturalistic behaviors) and correlate the animals' movement with changes in neural activity. Recent research has demonstrated that even sensory areas have representations of motor and behavioral variables, and vice versa. This is often called \"multiplexed\" coding. Furthermore, neural encoding can be influenced by <b>cognitive</b> processes such as learning, task engagement, and decision making. \n",
    "\n",
    "The exact form of neural activity changes is also a part of the study of neural coding. Neurons can represent information based on their average firing rates over a period of time, based on the precise spike times relative to some event, using bursts of spikes, or based on synchrony and timing relative to global population activity. In this workshop, we will consider <b>average firing rates</b> as they relate to information coding.\n",

    "\n",
    "<p> Many studies over the last decade have shown that animal behavior, attention, and learning can influence neural coding even in sensory areas, often in a cell type specific way. Here are a few examples: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Animal movements, including locomotion, can alter the gain of sensory responses in the visual cortex **(Niell 2011; Darladat 2017)** and aross the brain **(Steinmetz 2019)**. \n",
    "* The influence of movement on sensory coding can be cell type specific **(DiPoppa, 2018)** and different populations of inhibitory neurons are jointly modulated by behavior and sensory features in distinct ways **(Millman 2020)**.\n",
    "* Attention and arousal (alertness), as indexed by pupil diameter, are associated with enhanced sensory coding through changes in neural correlations among specific cell types **(Poort 2022)**.\n",
    "* Sensory tuning can also be shaped by learning to associate a stimulus with a reward **(Shuler 2006, panel b)**, sharpening tuning and enhancing response reliability **(Poort 2018; Khan 2020)**. \n",
    "* Repeated experience with a sensory stimulus can lead to changes in neural representations, including developing predictive activity and expectation signals **(Fiser 2016)**\n",
    "* Novelty, surprise, and stimulus omission also reveal cell type specific differences in coding properties **(Garrett 2019, 2023)**.\n",

    "There may be additional dimensions of sensory or behavioral events that are of interest - can you think of any? \n",

    "\"Overfitting\" is a term used to describe the case in which learns does very well in describing the data that it is trained on, but fails to predict new or additional data. Another way of saying this that a model will learn to describe noise or idiosyncrasies of the training data, rather than the underlying relationships that you are trying to model.\n",
    "\n",

Regression is a guided dimensionality reduction exercise, where we try and describe our data with a chosen set of features. The saturated model fails to do this. Second, this model is worthless for explaining new data. It assumes a 1-to-1 $x_i\\rightarrow y_i$ mapping, and is undefined for new points or allows assumes no variance for repeated observations.\n",

Regression models offer a way to screen large amounts of data. You might, for example, fit a regression model to every cell in the Visual Behavior dataset to ask \"which cell types are most modulated by running speed.\" \n",
    "<p>\n",
    "In the next tutorial, we will learn about a related set of tools called \"Decoding Models.\" These models allow you understand what is encoded in a neural population by explicity decoding that information from a recoding. These techniques are often used in tandem - you might, say, decode running from an entire population of neurons, then use regression models to look at how individual cells suport your decoding analysis.\n",

    "<b> (2) Regression models are predictive </b>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "Here, we focused entirly on cases where we were predicting similar but held out data with our model. Often, however, we use regression to look at differences between condition by fitting a model on one condition and predicting on the other. This is very related to what we did with hits and misses: by seperating the design matrix there, we effectivly trained one model on 'hits' and another on 'misses.' An alternative way of doing this analysis would have been to see how well (or badly) the hit model did at predicting miss trials or visa-vera.\n",

    "Everything we have done here is commonly refered to as a \"General Linear Model,\" or gLM. These are super useful, but this model class makes a big assumption about the variance distribution of our data: specifically, we assumed that variance is normally distributed about some mean value, $f(x)$. This is mathmatically the easiest thing to do, but it turns out to not always be the best assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "<p> \n",
    "In fact, there is a very specific case that often arrises in neuroscience where we know this assumption to be particularly bad: Spike trains. Spikes are discrete, transient events. Over a given time interval, there can never be fewer than 0 spikes, and there can never be a fractional number of spikes. If we assume that spikes are occure indepently with an average rate (call it $\\lambda$), then a poisson distribution (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution) can be shown to be a good model of this variance. We can make a regression model that assumes poisson variance if we fit the following:\n",

    "Here, adding the $ln(*)$ term makes the model harder to fit, but fortunatly, `sklearn` ships with an implementation of poisson regression. It can also handle other commonly used non-linearities (called link functions) (e.g. those for exponential data, logistic data, etc. https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#generalized-linear-models). \n",

You will sometimes also hear of these models refered to as \"Linear-Non-linear\" models, because the linear and nonlinear parts can be mathematically seperated.\n",
